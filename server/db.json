We have two children, a 7 year old girl and a 6 year old boy. We have been living in Amsterdam for 20 years and love the city! We enjoy the relaxed vibe and the fact that the city is so compact: One can walk or bike anywhere. \r\n\r\nWe are first time airbnb renters, but have done several home exchanges over the last years, all very successful. \r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to host you in our lovely house!",

I join AirBnb because I really like to meet new (foreign) people.The past 8 years till now I have worked succesfully in my current position at Roeland Associates, a medium sized PR firm. In everyday operations I am responsible for a team of 8 members. Our main goal is to deliver the best in communications strategy to our clients so they can reach their business and communication goals. The assignments come mainly from the private sector. During the weekends and holidays I love visiting foreign cities and play tennis and squash in a very competitive way.\r\nAfter finishing the School of Economics, I started my career at one of the leading Dutch employment agencies.",

There is a good connection to/from the airport as well by bus and train. The apartment consists of a living room, and 2 bedrooms. The bedroom you can rent has a 2 personbed and is directly connected to the balcony (southern side so with a lot of sun). You can use the facilities in the living room (tv, dvd) and of course you can use the wifi. The apartment has a central heating system so all places can be heated in winter. The kitchen consists of all necessary equipment and has a big fridge and freezer. Around the corner there is a supermarket as well as many food take away places and coffee bars.",

      "neighborhood_overview": "The upcoming gentrification of historic hubs in central Athens (zone 1) particularly ANO PETRALONA, seemed the perfect location for seekers of a true urban experience. The area caters to artists, architects, creatives, IT specialists, and start up companies that want a \"down-town\" office in Athens. It is at the foot of famous Philoppapou Hill (Hill of the Muses). What makes Ano Petralona a \"preferred\" location: / safe neighborhood, one of the few typically local Greek neighborhoods in Athens.  Nearby evening life keeps the place alive with young people at late hours.  / situated in the heart of urban & historic Athens (walking to Acropolis, Thision and Plaka .. via Filoppapou Hill) / access to coffee shops, restaurants ... caf\u00e9s (at Platea Mercuri - Mercuri Square) up the road and restaurants (at Troon Street)  close to home / easy transport (bus and train-metro Petralona station) ... alternative options  / short drive (5 min) to main highways / a cyclist paradise / close to green area",

      "host_about": "Hello everyone! \r\n   I am Sissy, I\u2019m fully affected by the Greek bright sun and blue sea and I love swimming and rolling in the waves.  \r\n   When going abroad, I consider myself a traveler, not a tourist. The difference between those two is that a traveler doesn\u2019t need to go with the mass but to explore himself. In order to do so, he needs to know that before the exploration and afterwards, there will always be a spotless house to rest, with warm bed, soft fresh linens and a comfortable kitchen. What a traveler needs is a home away from home.\r\nBy offering my places through airbnb I put my own delight in a first place. In each traveler I see myself when being abroad and think what was that missing from my own trips. For this reason, I decorated all of my places on my own and I was thrilled about the future guests. This satisfaction makes the hosting experience a hobby, and never a job.\r\n   It is a great honor for me to receive your enjoyment when staying at my apartment. You are always welcome!",

Together we run, jog and roam the city. I want to travel more, so I signed up for this site in hopes to get out of the city and have nice people stay at my place to help me pay for my adventures. \r\n\r\nI love finding new bars and restaurants, and the Upper East Side is the perfect place to do just that. \r\n\r\nIf you're visiting the city, I'd say definitely bring along a subway map because taxis can be pricey, and always bring an iPod or music with you. It's a great way to pass the time while you walk around, and make your own city soundtrack.",

You can use the bike map to decide if this is a good option for you based on your itinerary and how much you like biking. We think that one of the best ways to enjoy Austin is by bicycle, and most people who have stayed with us have loved the freedom of being able to bike around the city. \u2022 Buses - There's a bus stop down the street from our house and Capital Metro's Trip Planner is pretty great for learning how to get from place to place. Buses generally arrive about every 20 minutes, but the buses aren't always on time and they don't run very late. You can also put bikes on the bus, but there is only space for two",

Bikes locked downtown overnight can easily be stolen, so it is your responsibility to bring the bike back to the house. Same goes for bike lights. Please take them off the bike when park",

I'm the one who manages our Airbnb listing, but I live with my partner, Miguel, and Catbus, an orange cat who adopted us a few years ago. Miguel works at a Mediterranean cafe, and also does screen printing, carpentry, and landscaping work. We both love meeting new people and opening up our home to fun folks who need a short-term place to stay in Austin.

We offer a home-y environment, not a pristine hotel. If anything is not working properly, we will do our best to get it taken care of. We both work full time so on-site response time may not be immediate! We ask that you not smoke on the property, but do let us know if you need anything. We love our spot here in Central Austin and look forward to sharing it with you!",

I grew up in South Carolina, spent a year studying in Innsbruck, Austria and graduated from the University of Notre Dame, before making my way to the warmer climate of Austin. We have 2 sons, ages 12 and 14. They are sweet, athletic boys who spend much of their time at the basketball courts and park across the street. Austin has been my home for 23 years and I love every single thing about it-the celebration of eccentricities, the live music, the vibrancy and activism, the weather and the fabulous people that make it such a special and unique town.",
